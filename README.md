# SIEM-LabðŸš¨
Looking to build a sophisticated, free SIEM lab with SOAR integrations? Search no further. 

An integration of some of the most powerful open-source tools to work together in your production environment to automate the generation of security alerts, slack messaging, active incident response, triage, and overall asset monitoring.

Sit tight!
<h1>How It Works ðŸ’»</h1>
This project aims at securing assets in a production environment that communicates over the internet. It monitors assets and pull logs from them in real-time. 

Well, that of course doesn't tell the full story. 

Wazuh-agents are pushed to the endpoints and these 'wazuh-agents' are responsible for pulling telemetry to Wazuh-manager.

Wazuh-manager is hosted locally and is connected to TheHive -a versatile case management system, inbuilt in it is MISP- a threat intelligence platform (CTI) and Cortex -a platform for active response and intelligence gathering.

Or, you can [Check out the wazuh documentation](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/quickstart.html) page.

# TheHive
For thehive to run optimally and efficiently, some other programs will be have to be installed along with it. For this installation, we will use docker. 
TheHive has [Cortex](https://docs.thehive-project.org/cortex/) and [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) integrated into it by default.

Use this [docker-compose](https://github.com/EmmyNwani/SIEM-Lab/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file to install thehive and its dependent applications.

Create a docker-compose.yml file and paste the contents of the [dockerfile](https://github.com/EmmyNwani/SIEM-Lab/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) into it.

Navigate to the path where the docker-compose.yml file is located and run a `docker-compose up -d` command to run the installation on docker.

After you are done installing the [docker-compose](https://github.com/EmmyNwani/SIEM-Lab/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file, you will need to set them up seperately via their web interfaces. 
Navigate to the web interface of [Cortex](https://docs.thehive-project.org/cortex/) and [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) to get your MISP and Cortex servers up and ready to be integrated with thehive by creating accounts and organizations on the platforms.

|4GB|80GB|

# Connecting TheHive and Wazuh 

For thehive and wazuh to work across board, two things must be done.

First, the custom python thive `custom-w2thive` integration must be downloaded and configured appropriately.
Secondly, wazuh's `ossec.conf` file will be edited and theHive's API and IP added to the `ossec.conf` file.
Follow the steps in [wazuh's page](https://wazuh.com/blog/using-wazuh-and-thehive-for-threat-protection-and-incident-response/) and be sure to follow the same indentation in the `ossec.conf` file. 

For reference, The [w2thive](https://github.com/EmmyNwani/SIEM-Lab/blob/main/custom-w2thive) and [w2thive.py](https://github.com/EmmyNwani/SIEM-Lab/blob/main/custom-w2thive.py) files can be found in this piece.
