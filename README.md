# SIEM-LabðŸš¨
Looking to build a sophisticated, free SIEM lab with SOAR integrations? Search no further. 

An integration of some of the most powerful open-source tools to work together in your production environment to automate generation of security alert, slack messaging, Incident response, triage, and overall asset monitoring.

Sit tight!
<h1>How It Works ðŸ’»</h1>
This project aims at securing assets in a production environment that communicates over the internet. It monitors assets and pull logs from them in real-time. 
Well, that of course doesn't tell the full story. 
Wazuh-agents are pushed to the endpoints and these 'wazuh-agents' are responsible for pulling telemetry to Wazuh-manager.
Wazuh-manager is hosted locally and is connected to TheHive -a versatile case management system, inbuilt in it is MISP- a threat intelligence platform (CTI) and Cortex -a platform for active response and intelligence gathering.
