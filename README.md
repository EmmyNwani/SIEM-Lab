# SIEM-LabðŸš¨
Looking to build a simple, free SIEM lab? Search no further. 

An integration of some very sophisticated open-source tools to work together in your production environment to automate generation of security alert, slack messaging, Incident response, triage, and overall asset monitoring.

Sit tight!
<h1>How It Works ðŸ’»</h1>
This project aims at securing assets in a production environment that communicates over the internet. It monitors assets and pull logs from them in real-time. 
Well, that of course doesn't tell the full story. 
Wazuh-agents are pushed to the endpoints and these 'wazuh-agents' is the responsible for pulling telemetry to Wazuh-manager.
Wazuh-manager is hosted locally but is connected to TheHive -a sophisticated case management system integrated with MISP and Shuffle -A platform which is responsible for alert forwarding via Slack and also for sending responsive actions to Wazuh-manager over the internet.
